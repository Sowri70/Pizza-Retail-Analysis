**Strategies**

Revamp Low Performers:
Reassess the Chicken Alfredo Pizza (worst seller) – improve recipe, rename, or offer limited-time promotions.

Manpower Planning:
It is worth noting that Noon time (between 12 noon & 2 PM) is the busiest period through out the week.   One can plan their manning
accordingly.  Also consider reducing manpower during lean hours thus saving considerable amount on payroll and other related expenses. 

Price Optimization:
Review and adjust pricing for Veggie pizzas to improve revenue per unit without affecting demand.
Consider bundle deals (e.g., Veggie + Drink) to increase average order value.

Promotional Campaigns:
Launch targeted discounts or combo offers for Chicken and Veggie categories.
Use loyalty rewards or limited-time offers to boost trial and repeat purchases.

Product Innovation:
Highlight unique ingredients or health benefits (e.g., "high-protein", "plant-based").

Menu Placement & Design:
Increase visibility of Chicken and Veggie options in menus and digital platforms (e.g., top listings, featured items).

Customer Feedback Loop:
Collect and analyze feedback specifically for underperforming pizzas – identify taste, portion, or presentation issues.

Cross-Selling Opportunities:
Encourage add-ons like dips, sides, or desserts with Veggie/Chicken pizzas to enhance perceived value.
